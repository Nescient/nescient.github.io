<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>2   Spring
Storm</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>This Circle
of Life is all about Spring—<i>Fecund</i> Spring.  Philip Yenawine, the
co-founder of Visual Thinking Strategies, a non-profit educational initiative, introduced
me to this powerful, evocative word through his superb facilitation skills.  The
etymology of the word <i>fecund </i>harkens back to the Latin word, “fruitful.”
The word speaks of new life, palpable growth, the pregnant earth waiting to
deliver spring.  This circle has the tingling energy of lightning, the swirl of
spring winds, and rain charging the plants to grow. The beech nut in the center
has split open to release a new tree.  Those early harbingers of spring--tulips--wend
their way through the circle. Small fragile leaves burst from their buds.
Sprouts emerge from the soil. I hope you feel the sense of movement and joy I
have tried to convey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>On another
level, this piece represents resurrection and new life.  As my granddaughter
and I were walking through the woods in early spring we kept crunching on the
acorns and beech nuts on the forest floor. I brought one of the split-open
beechnuts home to draw for this Circle of Life and thought about Jesus’ parable
of the seed in John 12.  Jesus was trying to prepare his disciples for his
death and he told them,</span><span class=text> </span><span class=text><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>“The time has come for the Son of Man
to be glorified. I tell you truly that unless a grain of wheat falls into the
earth and dies, it remains a single grain of wheat; but if it does, it brings a
good harvest.”  Jesus was talking about his time to die and his glorious
resurrection—the incredibly “good harvest.”  The wind and the crackling
lightning in this mandala also speak of the incredible power of that
resurrection and the power of God working in our hearts to bring us to
Himself--God’s creation teaching us lessons about the Creator.</span></span></p>
