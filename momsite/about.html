                        A little
                        about myself--I’m a wife, mom, Oma, former teacher in the Syracuse City School
                        District and former Associate Curator of Education at the Everson Museum of Art.
                        I sometimes teach Visual Thinking Strategies, an amazing approach to improving
                        critical thinking, language, and social skills, in schools and museums around
                        the country.  Now that I’m retired I love to babysit my grandchildren, travel, and
                        DO ART!

                        I also love
                        God and have a strong desire to help those who are persecuted and oppressed. I
                        heard Christine Caine speak about the work of The A21 Campaign to end human
                        trafficking in the 21<sup>st</sup> century; and I knew I had to do something to
                        help.  I prayed for a way to support this work and amazingly God has set me on
                        this path of creating <i>Circles of Life</i>—mandalas that joyfully represent His
                        creative hand in our world. I am committed to donating at least 20% of all
                        sales to A21. I love the beautiful collaboration of my line drawings and your
                        coloring choices. Lots of people have mentioned the calming, therapeutic nature
                        of coloring these Circles of Life. I’m thankful that we can work together to
                        end human trafficking and create things of beauty.

                        I do <b>
                            COLORING
                            PARTIES
                        </b>—teaching color theory and giving coloring tips to help people enjoy
                        their art more. I also give information about human trafficking and can’t help
                        but share the God behind my art.  I can do these workshops at your home, civic
                        organization, or church. For more information, please <a href="contact.html">call or e-mail</a>.
