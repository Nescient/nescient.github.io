            <h3>Welcome to the Circles-of-Life homepage.</h3>
            <p>
                Please view the <a href="about.html">About</a> page to read information on who I am and why I draw these circles.  You can see
                drawings that are for sale on the <a href="gallery.html">Product Gallery</a> page. I am selling these drawings as greeting cards (6in square),
                11in x 11in prints, and 18in x 18in prints.  You can order them as uncolored prints or colored prints.  To see some of the
                coloring options, please view the <a href="testimonials.html">User Gallery</a> page.  Please indicate in the PayPal comment section how
                you would like a print colored (this will be after you checkout, but before you verify the order on the PayPal website).  Otherwise, artistic license applies ;)
            </p>
            <p>Please note that all of the images shared on this site have watermarks.  The print that you receive will <b>not</b> have the grid and spiral watermark.</p>
            <p>11 x 11 black and white coloring pages and cards are 1 for $5, 3 for $12, or 6 in an artist folder for $25.</p>
            <p>18 x 18 posters and 11 x 11 colored prints are 1 for $15, 2 for $25, 3 for $30 and 18 x18 colored prints are $30.</p>
